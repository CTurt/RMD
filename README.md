RMD - Realtime Markdown editing
===============================
An online, realtime Markdown editor. Try it [here](http://cturt.github.io/RMD/).

It lets me see how my articles will appear in my site's theme, as I write them. It is probably of little use to anyone apart from myself.

Uses [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for Markdown to HTML conversion.
